tenantSignUp(tenantName, password):
	- add tenant to Tenants table in CSPDb database. tenantID. tenantSubnet = parse all subnets IPs, sort and take the next one. (account for the CloudServiceProvider's subnet).

tenantLogin(tenantName):
	- generate random session key, store in global variable. Encrypt with tenantPassword and send.
	- All further messages will be encrypted with the session key. 

decryptTenantMessage(message):
	- access session key stored in the global variable and decrypt the client's message.

tenantInitialize(webRole, workerRole, noOfWebRoles, noOfWorkerRoles): 
	- create tenant host container (x.x.x.1), add to the TenantComponents table
	- create specified number of webRoles and workerRoles, add to the TenantComponents table
	- save WebRole and WorkerRole files locally, so that more can be created if needed.

addWebRoles(noOfWebRoles):
	- get list of all Web Role IPs by that tenant from TenantComponents, identify the nextIPs. (include the missing IPs - can be missing because the Web Roles no longer exist).
	- create the number of webRoles specified and add them to the TenantComponents table and to the Loads table.

addWorkerRoles(noOfWorkerRoles):
	- get list of all Worker Role IPs by that tenant from TenantComponents, identify the nextIPs. (include the missing IPs - can be missing because the Web Roles no longer exist).
	- create the number of webRoles specified and add them to the TenantComponents table and to the Loads table.

removeComponent(componentID):
	- used if some component fails (informed by HealthMonitor)
	- delete container
	- remove component from TenantComponents, Loads tables (only TenantComponents in case of Hosts)
	- Notify the UI, with option to recreate (need to display metadata about the failed component from TenantComponents + Tenants tables).

removeWebRoles(noOfWebRoles):
	- x = list of non-active Web Role IPs (got from Load Balancer).
	- if x < noOfWebRoles - error
	- remove noOfWebRoles Web Roles randomly from x. Update the TenantComponents table and the Loads table.

removeWorkerRoles(noOfWorkerRoles):
	- x = list of non-active Web Role IPs (got from Load Balancer).
	- if x < noOfWebRoles - error
	- remove noOfWebRoles Web Roles randomly from x. Update the TenantComponents table and the Loads table.

getTenantUsageStats(tenantName):
	- return status of Web Roles, Worker Roles (being used currently or not) from LoadBalancer
	- current loads of all components
	- IP of each Web Role, Worker Role and time it was active for.

getHealthStats():
	- poll Health Monitor for stats of all components.
	- report if any have shutdown/stopped.

restartComponent(componentID):
	- restart the component

remake(moduleName):
	â€¢ recreate the container, after destroying the old one.
